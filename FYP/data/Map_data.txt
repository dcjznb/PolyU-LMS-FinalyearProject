Physically, consumer drones can carry 0.2 kg to 2 kg (0.4–5.5 lbs), while heavy-lift models like the CW-80E handle up to 25 kg (55 lbs). Industrial giants like the Griff 300 lift over 500 kg (1,100 lbs).
Legally, the FAA limits commercial drones to 25 kg (55 lbs) under Part 107 rules. In the EU, drones over 250g require certifications, with fines or crashes likely if exceeded.
